## Demographic Comparison

Here's a plot:

https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/advanced.html#absolute-position


## County Trends

80% of employees are white, which is representative of where the county was 10 years ago


## Next Steps

::: {.incremental}
-   examine more demographic factors (ethnicity, orientation)
-   look into employee trends over time
-   Intersectionality & covariance (e.g. GIVEN the age composition or geographic composition of employees, what SHOULD we expect?)
:::

## Notes

A few other things to mention

::: {.incremental}
-   Created using R (ggplot2, Quarto)
-   Slides & plots created with code: reproducible & repeatable 
-   Posted to Github: backup, transparency & confidence
